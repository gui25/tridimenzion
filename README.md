# Tridimenzion 🎨

Tridimenzion is a gallery of 3D ART, showcasing various artworks created using Three.js, React Three Fiber, and Drei. This project is built with a modern tech stack, including TypeScript, Next.js, Styled Components, Jest, React Testing Library, Storybook, Eslint, Prettier, and Husky.

## Project Goals 🎯

- **Increase Test Coverage**: One of the goals of this project is to increase the test coverage to ensure robustness and reliability of the application.

- **Refine Componentization**: The project aims to refine the componentization for better maintainability, reusability, and readability of the codebase.

- **Improve Polishing**: Initially, this project was developed rapidly, and as a result, certain aspects may not be as polished. The goal is to iterate and improve on these aspects to enhance the overall user experience and code quality.
